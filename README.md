# Setup

1. Create a fork and clone the repo
2. Run `npm install` [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install)
3. Run `npm run json-server` [json-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server)
4. In a separate terminal, Run `npm run dev` (Should have two terminals running, 1 for the json server & 1 for the UI)

## Test Instructions

1. Add functionality and improve code
   - The minimum goal is that the user should be able to view, add, update, and delete contacts when you are done (the async methods to accomplish this are provided already)
   - After completing base functionality, focus on improving the code and/or the UI/UX. It might be nice to make it look better.
   - Use any libraries you think will help you accomplish what you want
   - Clean up any TypeScript errors
2. Update this README file
   - List changes you make and brief explanations of why you made them under "Changes Made"
   - If you don't have time to complete everything you'd like to, list further changes under "Changes Needed"
3. Finally, in a last commit, share your thoughts about the test under "Final Thoughts." What went well? What were the challenges?

## Evaluation Criteria

1. Your thought process
   - Listing your changes and why you made them is just as important as your code. We want to understand how you think about code.
2. Your code
   - Best practices
   - Readability
   - Reliability
3. UI/UX
